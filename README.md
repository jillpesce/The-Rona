# Project Description
  In this current situation with COVID-19, people are in constant fear and uncertainty. We often try to ground ourselves in data and facts, but the perpetuation of fake news is prevalent in our society. We made a website that presents live-updated data about COVID-19 in a way that the layperson can easily comprehend. We hope to lessen the confusion and uncertainty surrounding this disease by providing the public with quick and easy data regarding its spread. 

In addition to COVID-19 data, we included data about the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. This will further ease the fear of users as they will be able to compare COVID-19 to other causes of death and gain perspective on the scope of the virus.
